# NVIDIA_jetson_nano_finger_counting_classification
The following code runs on NVIDIA JETSON NANO with an either CSI Camera or USB Camera. Appropriate widgets have been imported and user collects the data of counting numbers by their fingers. It can later be trained and cross valdated by changing backgrounds. 
This is a classical learnning example for deep learning enthusiasts since all the computations are done in runtime on the edge by means of the powerful CPU Nvidia Jetson Nano.
